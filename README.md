# Prive

A very simple solution to basic privacy on internet

## Motivation
There are multiple ways websites you visit track and follow you around even after you have closed the tabs.
The most popular way is via cookies [cookies](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/mozilla-explains-cookies-and-supercookies/) and trackers [trackers](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/mozilla-explains/what-is-a-web-tracker/)

## What the xtension does
Everytime you visit a website after you close the tab this extension deletes all the cookies and trackers the website leaves behind.
